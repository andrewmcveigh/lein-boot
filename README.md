# lein-boot

A Leiningen plugin to run ring-servlet with Servlet 3 API.

## Usage

Put `[com.andrewmcveigh/lein-boot "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector
of your project.clj.

You'll need the following dependencies:

```clojure
[ring/ring-servlet "1.1.0" :exclusions [javax.servlet/servlet-api]]
```

You'll also want a servlet jar, and maybe ring/ring-devel. Probably best to put
these in your :dev profile:

```clojure
:profiles {:dev {:dependencies [[org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-webapp "8.1.0.RC5"]
                                [ring/ring-devel "1.1.0"]]}}
```

## Example

    $ lein boot
    $ lein boot :port 8080
